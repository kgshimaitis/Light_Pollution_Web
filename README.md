# Light_Pollution_Web

I created this website to serve as a resource for those who wish to learn about light pollution, and its effects on the environment and daily life. The first tab is to educate people about what light pollution is, the second is to show its effects, there is an Intercative map iframe, that allows you to view current light pollution levels.
On the interactive map, it open to New York City, but you can search any location in the world and view the Bortle Scale overlayed on the map.
The Gallery serves as a place to look at pictures found on the site, as well as images taken in place with limited lighy pollution, in order to fully gauge what our night sky could be without light pollution.
